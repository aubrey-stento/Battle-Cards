    <h2>Enter your player name, and select a deck number (1-4) to start a game. You will automatically be assigned an opponent and redirected to a game screen.
    Select a card to play, then select the card you would like to attack from your opponent's hand, and press 'Attack'. The results are determined and the values
    of health, attacks, and defense will be adjusted. Repeat this process until a player runs out of gards.  </h2>
